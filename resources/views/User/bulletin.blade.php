                        <p>The Social Security System (SSS) in the Philippines provides social insurance benefits for private sector employees. Recent changes under Republic Act No. 11199 increased the SSS contribution rate from 11% to 12%, raised the Monthly Salary Credits (MSC) to P2,000, and set the maximum MSC at P20,000. Contributions for employees earning P2,250 or less are P80, with employers contributing P160, totaling P240. For those earning P19,750 or more, employees contribute P800, with employers adding P1,600, making a total of P2,400. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) applies a simpler calculation: employees contribute 9% of their compensation, while employers contribute 12%. Constitutional commissioners and judiciary officers contribute 3% each, with their employers matching that amount</p>

Employees earning up to P10,000 pay a minimum of P137.50 each, while those earning P40,000 or more pay a maximum of P1,100, with both employee and employer contributing up to P550 each. Contributions are rounded to two decimal places and matched equally between employee and employer.</p>

                        <p>
PhilHealth, the Philippine Health Insurance System, mandates that all employees have health insurance coverage. Employers must deduct part of employees' salaries for PhilHealth and remit the payments.

As of January 2018, under PhilHealth Circular No. 2017-2004, the total monthly premium is 2.75% of the employee's basic salary, split equally between employee and employer. Employees with a gross monthly salary of P10,000 or less pay a minimum of P137.50, while those earning P40,000 or more pay a maximum of P1,100, with both the employee and employer each contributing up to P550. Contributions are rounded to the nearest hundredth, with equal shares from both employee and employer.</p>

                        <h3>13th Month Pay</h3>
                        <p>Under Presidential Decree 851, employers in the Philippines are required to provide a 13th month pay to all rank-and-file employees who have worked for more than one month during the year. This payment, equivalent to one-twelfth of the employee’s gross basic annual salary, must be given by December 24 each year.

Leaves without pay are not included in the annual salary calculation for the 13th month pay. While the 13th month pay is taxable, it is exempt from tax if the total, including other benefits, does not exceed P90,000. Any amount above this threshold is subject to tax.</p>
